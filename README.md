App for climbers to test and monitor finger strength. It works with the WH-C06 bluetooth crane scale which you can buy on AliExpress (With free shipping and takes about 10 days) for about $30 [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806312872948.html), [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806012892302.html), and [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807190074678.html) among others. **Make sure it has bluetooth, there are options with and without** .  You can alternatively get one off Alibaba [here](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Smart-WH-C06-Digital-Electronic-Hanging_1601242156410.html), [here](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/USB-Rechargeable-WH-C06-300KG-Electronic_1601242039585.html), or [here](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Weiheng-WH-C06-Blue-Tooth-Industrial_1601242025682.html) but they have a minimum order quantity of 2 so if you have a friend that wants one this is a viable solution. Similar price of about $29 each after shipping cost but has a shipping time of 1-2 months. There may be ones on amazon but at this time the bluetooth one is not available there.

**Current features :**
  1. Live data view. Just see what you're pulling and gives you a max and average for the session.
  2. Repeaters. Set the number of sets, reps, work time, rest time, time between sets etc.
  3. Peak load. Just a max weight pulled during the session.
  4. Critical force with W' calculations after the test.
  5. Save sessions to view them later in the app
  6. Export the data to CSV. If you want to save the data to your computer to do further calculations or visualizations or if you simply want to share it with others.
  7. Profiles to quickly and easily swap between people using the device. Admittedly the profiles are barebones but since everything is only stored locally and not uploaded anywhere, there's not really a need to have more than just a name.

**Future features:**
  1. Much better UI. Right now it's just functional.
  2. Sound when below or above target pull weight in repeaters
  3. Update UI color when in dark theme or have a set color scheme. Right now the graph numbers are hard to read when in dark theme.

**Features not present**
  1. Rate of force development (RFD). The scale only reports at 8hz and this is not fast enough to give any useful information in this area. You'll need closer to 100-500hz for any useful information.
